# Tic Tac Toe

## Project Description

This webpage is my own implementation, and is part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

The purpose for creating this webpage was to learn about alternative methods for creating objects in Javascript, aside from using function constructors. The main features used to create this webpage are factory functions and module patterns.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Functionality that allows player v player/player v computer.
* Forms where player can submit names and choose between 2 player/computer mode.
* DOM manipulation where the players can click a cell to input their marker.
* Logic where only one player can choose at a time.
* Use of factory function pattern to create new objects.
* Use of IIFE to dynamically create a gameboard using javascript.

To-do list:
* Finish logic for form that chooses between 2 players/computer.
* Improve the UI.
* Fix bug that says game is a tie if entire board is filled (regardless if a player has winning pattern upon filling the board).
* Make the page responsive with the use of Media Queries.
